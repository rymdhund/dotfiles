### Activating the layout

```
xkbcomp -I$HOME/dotfiles/keyboard conf.xkb $DISPLAY
```

### Getting different desktops to recognize the layout

```
cat symbols/dvorak_rh >> /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/se
setxkbmap se dvorak_rh
```

But this wont work on wayland

To get gnome etc to recognise your layout (and maybe make it work in wayland) add this to /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/evdev.xml (In the end of the swedish <VariantList>)

```
        <variant>
          <configItem>
            <name>dvorak_rh</name>
            <description>Swedish (Rymdhund)</description>
          </configItem>
        </variant>
```

This might be needed to reload:
sudo dpkg-reconfigure xkb-data

## MacOS

Put the dvorakrh.keylayout in "~/Library/Keyboard Layouts/" and you should be able to find it in keyboard settings.

Recommend to switch cmd and opt buttons and run it with esc on caps-lock.
